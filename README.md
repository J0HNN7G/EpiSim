#### The following aided us greatly with implementing our solution in JavaFX.  
- [JavaFX Tutorials](https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/) - These tutorials were amazing, [Marco Jakob](https://code.makery.ch/about/) did an outstanding job with them.

- [JavaFX animation experiments](https://gist.github.com/james-d/8327842) - A bouncing ball simulation project done by [James D](https://gist.github.com/james-d). Provides a large backbone for the wall collision response and model class.

- [JavaFX pane clipping](https://news.kynosarges.org/2016/11/03/javafx-pane-clipping/) - This tutorial helped us with overcoming that JavaFX pane's do not have a straight-forward clipping property, thanks [Christopher Nahr](https://news.kynosarges.org/author/cnahr/).

#### The following provided JavaFX UI assets 
- [JFoenix](http://www.jfoenix.com/) - JFoenix controls provided an elegant and professional styling for our UI controls ([Apache 2.0](http://www.jfoenix.com/documentation.html#License)). 

- [BootstrapFX](https://github.com/kordamp/bootstrapfx) - BootstrapFX makes up most of the Epi's CSS styling.
